# mediquik
According to official statistics, our nation requires 4 crore units of blood while only 40 lakh units are actually available. People are dying because their isn't much blood in the blood banks. Just A single car accident victim can require as many as 100 units of blood. On the other hand, India has population of 1.1 billion people who are eligible for donating blood, and many of us want to donate. 

So why not connect these two? The objective of our hack is connecting these needful people with the volunteers with the same blood group who are in that vicinity. Mediquik is a location based emergency health app which enables users in dire need to search for volunteer doctors and blood donors in their immediate vicinity. 

We dreamt of a platform where people can volunteer for blood donation, doctors can volunteer for the people in times of emergency for the people in need around them. 

Accomplished : 

1. People can volunteer by registering with the app and giving the blood group and other standard details.

2. People in need enter the blood group, number of units and the address. Our app searches for the volunteers with that blood group in a 30km radius. Automated emails are sent to these volunteers with the contact info of the person in need. Along with this, the victim can see all the volunteers as markers on google map. On clicking the marker, the needy can go to the profile page of the volunteer and establish a direct contact with them (call and email). 

3. Doctors can volunteer by registering with the app and entering their speciality and degree.

4. In cases of emergency, people need to enter the note, that will be sent to all the volunteer doctors in the vicinity (currently 30km ). Automated emails are sent to these volunteers with the contact info and note. Along with this, the victim can see all the volunteers as markers on google map. On clicking the marker, the needy can go to the profile page of the volunteer and establish a direct contact with them (call and email). 

After the Hackathon :

1. Their is a great potential in this idea to practically curb the shortage of blood supply. Imagine hundreds of volunteers around you at any given time with the same blood group who can reach to you in 5 minutes time. 

2. If the idea gets popular, it has the potential to save thousands of lives. 

3. We plan to integrate Hospitals and NGOs with our app to provide a comprehensive database of voluntary blood donors and doctors. So the hospital can directly see the volunteers in that area and notify them.

4. We would also like to expand on our location based feature by providing features like donating unexpired drugs and other medical supplies to NGOs and hospitals.
